     * An Id only version of RedBean's existing RedBean_Plugin_Optimizer_Datetime.
     * It may seem ridiculous to derive this from RedBean_Plugin_Optimizer_Datetime,
     * but almost the entirety of the class is common to any kind of plugin optimizer
     * so there is no point in repeating it even though the id optimizer should not
     * subclass something called datetime optimizer. If at some stage the commonality
     * in RedBean_Plugin_Optimizer_Datetime and RedBean_Plugin_Optimizer_Shrink are
     * refactored into a base class (RedBean_Plugin_Optimizer is already taken) this
     * should take advantage of that.
