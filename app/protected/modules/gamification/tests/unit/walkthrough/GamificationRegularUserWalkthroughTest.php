     * Gamification Module
     * Walkthrough for a peon user.  The peon user at first will have no granted
     * rights or permissions.  Most attempted actions will result in an ExitException
     * and a access failure view.  After this, we elevate the user with added tab rights
     * so that some of the actions will result in success and no exceptions being thrown.
     * There will still be some actions they cannot get too though because of the lack of
     * elevated permissions.  Then we will elevate permissions to allow the user to access
     * other owner's records.
